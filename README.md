# Responsive-Portfolio_Robert-Greenawalt


This website is a personal landing space for my own projects; I have includeded a Home/About page, a Portfolio page, and a Contact page. My bio and personal image can be found in the Home/About section. The portfolio page will continue to grow as I add more projects. 

The nav bar is consistent on all webpages and the links are all responsive. Throughout the website, responsiveness can be seen through the variety of clickable buttons and links; even the images under my portfolio are responsive.

Semantic html was used throughout.
